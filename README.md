    Here MEX C++ / Cuda routines for sparse image approximation are presented as well as their MATLAB counterparts.  
    OMP3D has been implemented in MATLAB and MEX C++ (Stability issues currently prevent block sizes larger than 8 x 8)
    SPMP3D has been implemented in MATLAB and MEX C++, whilst a CUDA implementation has been outlined to utilise GPU.
